Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol Value
I 1
V 5
X 10
L 50
C 100
D 500
M 1000
For example, 2 is written as II in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. 12 is written as XII, which is simply X + II. The number 27 is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9.
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90.
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Solve in Python:

```python
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        
```

  Here is a possible implementation of the `romanToInt` function:
```
class Solution:
    def romanToInt(self, s: str) -> int:
        roman_numerals = {
            'I': 1,
            'V': 5,
            'X': 10,
            'L': 50,
            'C': 100,
            'D': 500,
            'M': 1000
        }
        result = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if i > 0 and roman_numerals[s[i]] > roman_numerals[s[i - 1]]:
                result -= roman_numerals[s[i - 1]]
            result += roman_numerals[s[i]]
        return result
```
This implementation uses a dictionary to map each Roman numeral to its corresponding integer value. It then iterates over the characters in the input string, and for each character, it adds or subtracts the corresponding integer value depending on whether it is greater than or less than the previous character. The resulting integer value is returned at the end.

For example, if the input string is `"XII"`, the function will first map the characters to their integer values:
```
X -> 10
I -> 1
I -> 1
```
Then it will add the values of the characters in order:
```
10 + 1 + 1 = 12
```
So the function will return `12`.

Note that this implementation assumes that the input string is a valid Roman numeral, and that it does not contain any invalid characters. If the input string contains invalid characters, the function will raise a `KeyError` exception. You can add error handling to the function as needed to handle such cases.
